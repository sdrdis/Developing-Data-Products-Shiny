Developing-Data-Products-Shiny
==============================

Here, we simply created a small application allowing you to know when you could be financially independent.

The presentation is here: http://sebastien.drouyer.com/Developing-Data-Products-Slidify/.

To use this application, simply download it, set the working directory of R to the directory when you downloaded the files, and execute "runApp('.')".

Or you can test it here: https://sdrdis.shinyapps.io/shiny/
